# Nice-to-Have Features and Practices in Android Development (Especially with Clean Architecture)

These are features and practices that, while not strictly necessary, greatly enhance the development process and the
quality of your Android application.

## General Android Development Nice-to-Haves

* **Comprehensive Logging:**
    * Implement a robust logging system (e.g., Timber) to track app behavior and debug issues efficiently.
    * Use different log levels (debug, info, warning, error) appropriately.
* **Feature Flags:**
    * Use feature flags to enable or disable features remotely, allowing for A/B testing and gradual rollouts.
    * This allows you to change app behavior without app updates.
* **Dependency Injection (DI):**
    * Utilize a DI framework (e.g., Hilt or Dagger) to manage dependencies and improve code testability and
      maintainability.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * Set up a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
    * This will save a lot of developer time.
* **Analytics Integration:**
    * Integrate analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics) to track user behavior and gather valuable
      insights.
* **Crash Reporting:**
    * Integrate a crash reporting tool (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics) to automatically track and report app crashes.
* **Accessibility:**
    * Design and develop the app with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it is usable by people with disabilities.
    * This includes proper use of content descriptions, and text sizing.
* **Localization:**
    * Implement String localization to support multiple languages.
* **Deep Linking:**
    * Implement deep linking to allow users to navigate directly to specific content within the app from external
      sources.

## Clean Architecture Nice-to-Haves

* **Modularization:**
    * Break down the app into smaller, independent modules to improve code organization and build times.
    * This is especially helpful for large projects.
* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles:**
    * Apply DDD principles to the domain layer to create a rich and expressive domain model.
    * This makes the domain layer very powerful.
* **Custom Lint Rules:**
    * Create custom Lint rules to enforce project-specific coding standards and architectural patterns.
    * This can help reduce code review time.
* **Contract Testing:**
    * If using APIs, implement contract testing to ensure that the app and the API communicate correctly.
* **State Management:**
    * Implement a robust state management solution (e.g., using StateFlow or sealed classes) to manage the app's state
      in a predictable and consistent way.
* **Testing Pyramid Adherence:**
    * Follow the testing pyramid, prioritizing unit tests for the domain layer, and integration tests for interactions
      between modules.
* **Documentation:**
    * Maintain up-to-date documentation for the architecture, modules, and key components of the app.
* **Data Caching:**
    * Implement a caching strategy in the data layer to improve performance and reduce network requests.
