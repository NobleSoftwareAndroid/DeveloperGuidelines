# Android Developer Guideline

### Introduction

<br>
The Android Developer Guidelines serve as a comprehensive framework, ensuring apps within the Android ecosystem
prioritize user safety, privacy, and a high-quality experience. Creating great android apps requires not only coding
skills, but also a thorough understanding of the Android developer guidelines, that are in place to ensure a consistent
and safe user experience. The Android Developer Guidelines encompass a wide spectrum of policies and best practices,
covering everything from app functionality and user privacy to store listing and monetization.
